# Chest-infection-classification



The December 2019 outbreak of COVID-19 has now evolved into a public health emergency of global concern. Given the rapid spread of infection, the rapid depletion of hospital resources due to high influxes of patients, and the current absence of specific therapeutic drugs and vaccines for treatment of COVID-19 infection, it is essential to detect onset of the disease at its early stages. Radiological examinations, the most common of which are posteroanterior chest X-ray (PCX) images, play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. The objective of this study is to assess three configurations of two convolutional deep neural network architectures for the classification of COVID-19 PCX images.
