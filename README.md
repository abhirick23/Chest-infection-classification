Deep learning is an important artificial intelligence tool, which plays a crucial role in solving many complex computer vision problems [1,2]. Deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used extensively for various image classification problems. However, such models perform optimally only when they are provided with a large amount of data. For biomedical image classification problems, such a vast amount of labeled data is difficult to acquire because it requires that expert doctors classify each image, which is an expensive and time-consuming task. Transfer learning is a work-around to surmount this obstacle. In this technique, to solve a problem that involves a small dataset, a model trained on a large dataset is re-used and the network weights determined in this model are applied. CNN models trained on a large dataset such as ImageNet [3], which consists of more than 14 million images, are frequently used for biomedical image classification tasks.
